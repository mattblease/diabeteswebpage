    <div<h1<p>Exercise</p><br>

    <div<p>Exercise Makes It Easier to Control Your Diabetes. People with diabetes are susceptible to developing blocked arteries (arteriosclerosis), which can lead to a heart attack. Exercise helps keep your heart healthy and strong. Plus, exercise helps you maintain good cholesterol—and that helps you avoid arteriosclerosis. </p><br>
<p>Exercise and sport<br>   
    You can exercise and do sports if you have type 1 diabetes. You'll just have to take some extra steps to make sure you do it safely.<br>
    
    Exercise and sport can affect your blood glucose levels. Depending on the type of activity you do, it may cause your blood glucose levels to rise (hyperglycaemia) or drop (hypoglycaemia).<br>
    
    Moderate exercise that lasts a while, like walking or cycling, can cause a slow drop in blood glucose levels.<br>
    
    Some exercise, like running or football, might cause your blood glucose levels to rise.<br>
    
    There are things you can do to help you manage your blood glucose levels.<br>
    
    You can avoid hypos by eating the right amount of carbs before, during and after exercise.<br>
    
    You should adjust your insulin and check your blood glucose regularly. Your diabetes team can help.<br>
    
    Exercise affects everyone differently and it might take a little while to find out what works for you. But try to stick with it.<br>
    
    Exercise is not only good for your physical and mental health, it also helps reduce glucose spikes after meals.<br>
    
    As a general rule:<br>
    
    check your blood glucose level before and during exercise – this'll help you work out what you should eat and when to adjust your insulin<br>
    record your blood glucose levels and what you eat when you exercise – share this with your diabetes team to help find what works for you<br>
    check your blood glucose levels regularly after exercise (they can drop up to 12 hours after exercise) – you may need to take extra carbohydrate or a lower dose of insulin before bed<br> 
    if you exercise, it's likely you'll need extra carbohydrate to prevent hypos<br>
    drink plenty of water while you exercise</p><br>
